Fight the Landlord (Dou Di Zhu) is a climbing game primarily for three players
In each hand one player, the "landlord", plays alone and the others form a team. The landlord's aim is to be the first to play out all his cards in valid combinations, and the team wins if any one of them manages to play all their cards before the landlord.

This game uses a 54-card pack including two jokers, red and black. The cards rank from high to low:
red joker, black joker, 2, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.
Suits are irrelevant.
